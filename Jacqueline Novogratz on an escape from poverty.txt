Transcription: I've been working on issues of poverty for more than twenty years until it's ironic that the problem that and question that I must grapple with is how you actually Define poverty what does it mean so I can we look at Dollar terms people making less than a dollar or two or three a day and yet the complexity of poverty really has to look at income as only one variable because really it's a condition about choice and the lack of freedom and I had an experience that really deep end and elucidated for me the understanding that I have is in Kenya and I want to share it with you I was with my friend Susan meiselas the photographer in the mosari valley slums now I'm sorry Valley is one of the oldest salons in Africa to bout three miles out of Nairobi and it's a mile-long about 2/10 of a mile wide we're over half a million people live Kramden is Littleton checks generation after generation renting them off
Transcription: eight or ten people to a room and it's known for prostitution violence drugs hard place to grow up and when we were walking through the narrow alley is it was literally impossible not to step in the raw sewage and the garbage alongside the Little Homes but at the same time it was also impossible not to see the human Vitality the aspiration in the ambition of the people who live there women washing their babies watching their clothes hanging them out to dry I met this woman Mama Rose who has rented that little tin check for 32 years or she lives with her seven children for sleep in one twin bed in three sleep on the mud and linoleum floor and she keeps them on school by selling water from that kiosk and from selling soap and bread from the little store inside was also the day after the inauguration and I was reminded how massari is still connected to the globe and I would see kids on the street corners and they say Obama he's our brother and I say will
Transcription: mom is my brother so that makes you my brother too and they would look quizzically and then high five and was here that I met Jane it was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness and her face and I asked her to tell me your story she started off by telling me her dream she said I had to my first Union was to be a doctor and the second was to marry a good man who would stay with me and my family because my mother was a single mom and couldn't afford to pay for school fees so I had to give up the first dream and I focused on the second she got married when she was a teen had a baby right away I want you turn 20 found herself pregnant with the second child I'm her mom died and her husband left her married another woman so she was again in Missouri with no income no skill set no money and so she'll probably turn to prostitution wasn't organized in the way we often think of it she will go into the city at night with about twenty girls look for work and sometimes come back with a few Shillings or sometime
Transcription: nothing and she said you know the property wasn't so bad it was the humiliation and embarrassment of it all in 2001 her life changed she had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization Johnny Bora that would lend money to people no matter how poor you were as long as you provided at the commencement man in savings and so she spent a year to say $50 and started borrowing and over time she was able to buy sewing machine she started tailoring and that turned into what she does now which is to go into the second hand clothing markets for about $3.25 to buys an old ball gown some of them might be ones you gave and she repurposes them with Frills in ribbons and makes these frothy Confections that she sells to women for their daughter's sweet 16 or First Holy Communion those milestones in a life that people want to celebrate All Along the economic spectrum and she does really good business in fact I watch
Transcription: walk through the streets Hawking and before you knew it there was a crowd of women around her buying these dresses and I reflected as I was watching her sell the dresses and also the jewelry that she makes now Jane makes more than $4 a day and by many definitions she is no longer poor but you still living with Ari Valley and so she can't move out she lives with all about insecurity and in fact in January during the ethnic Riot she was chased from her home and had to find a new Shack in which she would live dummy boy understands that and understands that when we're talking about poverty we've got to look at people all along the economic spectrum and so with patient capital from Acumen and other organizations loans and Investments that will go the long-term with them they built a low-cost Housing Development about an hour outside Nairobi Central and they designed it from the perspective of customers like Jane herself insisting on responsibility and accountability so she has to go
Transcription: 10% of the mortgage of the the total value or about $400 in savings and then they match her mortgage to what she paid in rent for her little Shanty and in the next couple of weeks she's going to be among the first 200 families to move into this development when I asked her if she feared anything or whether she would miss anything from the sorry she said what would I see her that I haven't confronted already I'm hiv-positive I've dealt with it all and she said what would I miss you think I'll miss the violence or the drugs the lack of privacy you think I'll miss not knowing if my children are going to come home at the end of the day she said if you gave me 10 minutes of my bags will be packed and so I said we'll worry about your dreams
Transcription: and she said well you know my dreams don't look exactly like I thought they would when I was a little girl
Transcription:  but if I think about it I thought I wanted a husband but what I really wanted was a family that was loving and I seriously love my children and they love me back and she said I want to be a doctor but what I really want to be with somebody who served and healed and cured and so I feel so blessed with everything that I have but two days a week I go and I Council HIV patients and I said look at me you are not dead you are still alive and if you are still alive you have to serve and she said I'm not a doctor who gets up pills but maybe me I got something better cuz I give them hope
Transcription:  and I'm in the middle of this economic crisis we're so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear I think we're well suited to take a cue from Jane and reach out recognizing that being poor doesn't means being ordinary because when systems are broken like the ones that were seeing around the world it's an opportunity for invention and Innovation it's an opportunity to truly build a world where we can extend services and products to all human beings so that they can make decisions and choices for themselves I truly believe it's for dignity starts we owe it to the chains of the world and just as important we owe it to ourselves thank you
