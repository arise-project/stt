Transcription: what you're doing right now at this very moment is killing you
Transcription:  more than cars or the internet or even a little mobile device we keep talking about the technology you're using the most almost every day is this your tush
Transcription:  nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day which is more than worth sleeping at 7.7 hours sitting is so incredibly prevalent we didn't question how much were doing it because everyone else is doing it it doesn't even occur to us that it's not okay and that way sitting has become the smoking of Our Generation
Transcription:  of course there's Health consequences to this scary ones besides the waist things like breast cancer and colon cancer are directly tied to our lack of physical inactivity 10% impact on both of those 6% for heart disease 7% for type 2 diabetes which is what my father died at
Transcription:  know any of those stats should convince each of us to get off our death more but if you're anything like me it won't
Transcription:  what did get me moving with a social interaction someone invited me to a meeting but couldn't manage to fit me into a regular sort of conference room meeting and said I have to walk my dogs tomorrow could you come that
Transcription:  kind of odd to do and actually that first meeting I remember thinking I have to be the one to ask the next question because I knew I was going to huff and puff to keep this conversation and yet I think that idea and made it my own so instead of going to Coffee meetings are fluorescent lit conference room meeting I asked people to go to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week
Transcription:  exchange my life
Transcription:  but before that what actually happened was I said think about it as you could take care of your health or you could take care of obligations and one always came at the cost of the other phone out several hundred of these walking meetings later I've learned a few things first there's this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads to out-of-the-box thinking whether it's a nature or exercise itself it certainly works at 2nd and probably the more reflective one is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition when they're really not that way and if we're going to solve problems and look at the world really differently whether it's in governance or business or environmental issues job creation maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems as having both things be true because it was when that happened with the Swap and talk idea that things became doable and sustainable enviable
Transcription:  so I started this talk talking about the fish sauce and with the bottom line we walk and talk walk the talk you'll be surprised at how fresh are drives fresh thinking and the way that you do you'll bring into your life and entirely new set of ideas thank you
